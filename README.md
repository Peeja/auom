SUnits
======

Small units implementation. It has less features when compared to ruby-units. 
But it is much smaller! Also it does not require mathn, so 1 / 2 is till 0 when 
you use this library.

This library is only tested and usable under MRI 1.9, it does not use an 1.9 
syntax, so it should be easily portable.
